# Gesture-Presentation
The project enables intuitive slide control with hand gestures, replacing traditional inputs. It includes drawing and erasing features, using a camera-based system to recognize gestures for seamless presentation control. This enhances human-computer interaction through real-time, nonverbal commands.
