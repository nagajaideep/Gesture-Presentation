This system enables intuitive control of presentation slides and offers drawing and erasing features. Hand gestures replace traditional input methods, providing a novel and organic nonverbal communication approach. Our project focuses on creating a camera-based technology for recognizing and utilizing user hand motions to control presentations seamlessly. This hand gesture recognition system enhances human-computer interaction, allowing users to operate a computer through real-time gesture detection instead of conventional input devices.
